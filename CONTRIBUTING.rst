## Contributing

First, thank you!

Contributions to the OpenQL libraries are very welcome!  We can't do this alone.
You can contribute in different ways: 
spread the word, report bugs, come up with ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are a few preferences regarding code contributions:

 - OpenQL's python source codes follow the Style Guide for Python Code as described [here](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
 - Make sure you properly unit test your changes.
 - Run the unit tests to make sure they all pass.
 - Write commit messages that make sense, and rebase your branch before submitting your pull request.
 - Send pull requests to the `feature-{%code-name%}` branch, not the `master` branch and the `develop` branch.
